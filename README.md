# FFTNN-TensorflowML
CNN made out of fft, for classification tasks.
This Classification Neural Network is made with tensorflow, make sure you have it installed, before you try this script.
I got inspired from a class i had, where the teacher told us that convolution in the time domain, was equivalent to a multiplication in a frequancy domain. i tried it and compared it with the CNN from Tensorflow's examples CNN. i stared this repo if you want to check it out, aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples.

# Applied to the MNIST
here are my results on my laptop, see the speed ? my laptop is bad :P
